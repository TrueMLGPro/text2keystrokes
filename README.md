<h1 align="center">text2keystrokes</h1>

This Python tool can automate keyboard input at a hardware level (only on Windows and Linux for now) ensuring that the keystrokes are transmitted as if they were manually typed by the user.

You can either enter the desired text directly into the console or provide a text file containing the desired content for this to process and generate the appropriate keystrokes.

You can also set your own intervals between keystrokes, to suit your specific requirements.
